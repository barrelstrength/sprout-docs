# Mailing Lists

A Report becomes a Mailing List when the `Email Column` setting is defined. The Email Column should reference a column that is returned by the report that provides a valid email address.

One or more Mailing Lists can be selected as Recipients for Notification Emails in Sprout Forms and Sprout Email. If the value returned by the Email Column does not validate as an email, it will be ignored.

::: tip Large Mailing Lists
The Mailing Lists feature is not yet designed to send to a large numbers of recipients. The max list size will vary depending on your list size and server resources. Be sure to test for your particular situation.

We do have plans to support large Mailing Lists. Please get in touch if you would like discuss a custom development project to get this feature prioritized: <a href="mailto:sprout@barrelstrengthdesign.com" target="_blank">sprout@barrelstrengthdesign.com</a>
