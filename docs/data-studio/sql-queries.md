# Custom SQL Queries

One reason Craft is powerful is because it allows users to build complex relational content from a very user-friendly UI. While that is nice for users, it can make certain queries very complex when retrieving your data.  Sprout Reports is designed to help make it easy for clients to run queries and get back the data they need. It is not designed to write those queries for you.

The examples below are not meant to be comprehensive or accurate for every situation. They are meant to be used as a starting point and the responsibility is on you to update the queries to meet your needs or find someone who can.  

::: tip
If you need help building a specific query, feel free to reach out.  We're happy to consider adding another example for common use cases or help out in a consulting relationship to help you meet your projects reporting needs.

## Relations Fields

Relation Fields (Entries, Categories, Users, Assets, and Tag fields) store their data via a related ID. This means a basic query will not return any information about the Relations Fields in an Entry. 

In this example, we create two queries: the first returning the data about our content from a particular section without the relation data and the second returning the data about all of the content related to our section.  We then use a `UNION` to combine the results of our two queries.

``` sql
SELECT content.id, 
       content.title,
       null as "Related IDs (comma-separated)",
       null as "Related Titles (comma-separated)"
FROM craft_content AS content
JOIN craft_entries AS entries
	ON entries.id = content.elementId
JOIN craft_relations AS relations
	ON entries.id = relations.sourceId
WHERE entries.sectionId = 2
UNION
SELECT relations.targetId AS relatedElementId,
	   content.title AS relatedContentTitle,
	   GROUP_CONCAT(content.elementId separator ',') AS "Related IDs (comma-separated)",
	   GROUP_CONCAT(content.title separator ',') AS "Related Titles (comma-separated)"
FROM craft_relations AS relations
JOIN craft_entries AS entries
	ON entries.id = relations.sourceId
JOIN craft_content AS content
	ON relations.targetId = content.elementId
WHERE relations.sourceId = entries.id
AND entries.sectionId = 2
GROUP BY relations.sourceId
```
