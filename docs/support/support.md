## Troubleshooting

When we run into a problem, we typically start with a few of the following things:

### Clear cache

Clear cache in the Craft settings. Clear cache in the browser. Try a different browser. Try a different network. Take a walk. Clear cache again!

### Upgrade to the latest software

Make sure you are using the latest version of Craft and all plugins on your website.
 
### Simplify the code you are working with to as simple as it gets

If you're trying to get code to work in a complex template, copy the code you are having trouble with and see if you can get it working in a blank template. Simplify the code in the area causing trouble to just output plain text, and then slowly add back more complexity variable by variable.

### Install a fresh version of the plugin

To help rule out plugin conflicts or upgrade issues, re-install your plugin on a temporary development site and create a quick prototype of what you are trying to do again and see if it works in a fresh environment.

## Support Questions

If you are unable to find an answer, support is available for Sprout license holders. We typically respond within 24-48 hours during the business week. We monitor support tickets during US business hours Monday-Friday, 9am-6pm ET (1pm-10pm GMT).

::: warning Last-minute Support
While we do offer license holders free support and do our best to solve any issues that come up in a timely manner, we are not able to guarantee a response time or time to resolution for all issues. Please plan your projects and upgrades with enough time to test and reach out with any questions.
