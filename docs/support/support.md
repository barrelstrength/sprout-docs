## Documentation & Troubleshooting

Our goal is to make the documentation the primary place that you can find answers. Please review the docs to get a deeper understanding of our plugins and find code examples.

When we run into a problem, we typically try a few of the following things:

- **Clear cache** - Clear cache in the Craft settings. Clear cache in the browser. Try a different browser. Clear cache again!
- **Upgrade to the latest** - Make sure you are using the latest version of Craft and all plugins on your website. 
- **Simplify the code you are working with to as simple as it gets** - If you're trying to get code to work in a complex template, copy the code you are having trouble with and see if you can get it working in a blank template. Simplify the code in the area causing trouble to just output plain text, and then slowly add back more complexity variable by variable.
- **Install a fresh version of the plugin** - To help rule out plugin conflicts or upgrade issues, re-install your plugin on a temporary development site and create a quick prototype of what you are trying to do again and see if it works in a fresh environment.

## Support Questions

If you are unable to find an answer, support is available for Sprout license holders. We typically respond within 24-48 hours during the business week. We monitor support tickets during US business hours Monday-Friday, 9am-6pm ET (1pm-10pm GMT).

::: warning Last-minute Support
While we do offer license holders free support and do our best to solve any issues that come up in a timely manner, we are not able to guarantee a response time or time to resolution for all issues. Please plan your projects and upgrades with enough time to test and reach out with any questions.
