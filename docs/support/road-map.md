# Road Map

The Sprout Plugins are in the process of being updated for Craft 4 and integrating many of the new features that Craft 4 makes available to custom Elements. We are taking the opportunity during this major release to simplify our codebase, migration process, and our non-core plugins.

We unfortunately can't provide any release dates, estimates, or guesses until we are ready to release. Please subscribe to the linked Craft 4 support issue below for any plugins that you wish to receive an update on once we release. If you have a time-sensitive need, you may have to roll your own update for now. We imagine this uncertainty will be frustrating to some, and hope the wait will be worth it for those who are able.

**\*** _The focus of our Fields and Lists plugins has always been to complement the necessary features in our core, commercial plugins. In addition, some features in both Fields and Lists are now supported by newer Craft features. While we're still sorting out where to draw the line, and we'll do our best to provide a migration path, expect some changes here._ 

**+** _If you would like to adopt and migrate any of the plugins that we do not plan to migrate, reach out and let us know at [sprout@barrelstrengthdesign.com](mailto:sprout@barrelstrengthdesign.com)._
