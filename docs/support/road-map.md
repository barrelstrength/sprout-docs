# Road Map

The Sprout Plugins are in the process of being updated for Craft 4 and integrating many of the new features that Craft 4 makes available to custom Elements. We are taking the opportunity during this major release to simplify our codebase, migration process, and our non-core plugins.

We unfortunately can't provide any release dates, estimates, or guesses until we are ready to release. If you have a time-sensitive need, you may have to roll your own update for now. We imagine this uncertainty will be frustrating to some, and hope the wait will be worth it for those who are able.

## Commercial Plugins

| Plugin            | Upgrade Status    |
|:----------------- |:------------------- |
| Sprout Forms      | In progress  |
| Sprout SEO        | In progress     |
| Sprout Redirects  | In progress |
| Sprout Sitemaps   | In progress |
| Sprout Email      | In progress  |
| Sprout Reports    | In progress |

## Open Source Plugins

| Plugin              | Upgrade Status    |
|:------------------- |:------------------- |
| Sprout Active       | Not planned<sup>+</sup> |
| Sprout Encode Email | Not planned<sup>+</sup>  |
| Sprout Fields       | In progress* |
| Sprout Import       | Not planned  |
| Sprout Lists        | In progress*  |
| Sprout Notes        | Not planned<sup>+</sup> |

**\*** _The focus of our Fields and Lists plugins has always been to complement the necessary features in our core, commercial plugins. In addition, some features in both Fields and Lists are now supported by newer Craft features. While we're still sorting out where to draw the line, and we'll do our best to provide a migration path, expect some changes here._ 

**+** _If you would like to adopt and migrate any of the plugins that we do not plan to migrate, reach out and let us know at [sprout@barrelstrengthdesign.com](mailto:sprout@barrelstrengthdesign.com)._
