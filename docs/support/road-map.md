# Road Map

The Sprout Plugins are in the process of being updated for Craft 4 and integrating many of the new features that Craft 4 makes available to custom Elements. We are taking the opportunity during this major release to simplify our codebase, migration process, and our non-core plugins.

We unfortunately can't provide any release dates, estimates, or guesses until we are ready to release and any comments we make to this end may be subject to change. (If we were not providing an estimate that was subject to change we might say that we hope to begin releasing some Sprout modules this year and have the full suite migrated by early 2023). Please subscribe to the linked Craft 4 support issue below for any plugins that you wish to receive an update on once we release. If you have a time-sensitive need, you may have to roll your own update for now. We imagine this uncertainty will be frustrating to some, and hope the wait will be worth it for those who are able.

Our [Road Map](https://github.com/orgs/barrelstrength/projects/3) can be viewed on Github.

**+** _If you would like to adopt and migrate any of the plugins that we do not plan to migrate, reach out and let us know at [sprout@barrelstrengthdesign.com](mailto:sprout@barrelstrengthdesign.com)._  

**\*** _The focus of our Fields and Lists plugins has always been to complement the necessary features in our core, commercial plugins. In addition, some features in both Fields and Lists are now supported by newer Craft features. The features of Fields and Lists that are used in our core, commercial plugins will be rolled into those plugins, but the standalone Fields and Lists plugins will be discontinued and any use cases outside of our core plugins will need to find alternate solutions. We'll do our best to provide guidance on the available options once we get the core plugins released._
