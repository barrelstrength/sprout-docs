# Updating Sprout

The Sprout plugins are built using the Sprout Framework â€“ a collection of modules. Plugin changelogs reference the modules that have changed, and the [Sprout Framework Changelogs](https://github.com/barrelstrength/sprout/tree/v5/CHANGELOG) document all the updates in the underlying modules.

[//]: # (Update guides are created for a plugin when there are notable changes. )

[//]: # (If you don't see an update guide, follow the standard Craft update process for the plugin.)

[//]: # (The update guides are organized by plugin and releases are listed by date.)
