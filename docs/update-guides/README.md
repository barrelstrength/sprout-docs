# Updating Sprout

The Sprout plugins are built using the Sprout Framework â€“ a collection of modules - so that plugins can share core functionality. Plugin changelogs reference the modules that have changed, and the [Sprout Framework Changelogs](https://github.com/barrelstrength/sprout/tree/v4/CHANGELOG) document all the updates in the underlying modules.

The upgrade guides are organized by plugin and releases are listed by date. Where appropriate, a plugin might link to update notes in another plugin. For example, the Sprout Forms changelog might link to the Sprout Email changelog for a particular update if notable changes have been made to email-specific features.

## Update Guides

The update guides are primarily for notable changes. Not all plugin versions will appear here in the update guides. See the changelogs for a given plugin for more detailed notes on every release.
