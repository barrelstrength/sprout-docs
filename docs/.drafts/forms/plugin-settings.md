# Settings

Settings can be managed in the Control Panel _Sprout Forms â†’ Settings_ or via a config file in `config/sprout-forms.php`

``` php

::: warning Front-end Editing
Forms are submitted anonymously by users, so unlike Entries which have Authors, you will need to manage and authenticate any users who are editing your front-end Forms.
:::

## Entry Statuses

Entry Status settings can only be edited in the Control Panel.

By default, Form Entries default to an **Unread** status and can be updated and marked **Read**. Entries that trigger Captcha errors will be given the **Spam** status. Rename the default statuses or customize additional Entry Statuses to fit your workflows in the settings.
