# Why Sprout?

Where Craft provides the excellent content management features, Sprout adds components specialized toward business and marketing use cases.

## Modular Architecture

As we developed Sprout we observed that a lot of features that we designed could benefit more than one use case. For example, our Reports features can be used on it's own, for running reports on Form submissions in Sprout Forms, and to build dynamic email lists in Sprout Email.

Rather than re-invent the wheel in each **plugin**, we chose to build out features such as Reports as a **module** that can be used by all of our plugins and for your custom reporting needs as well. Users experience a unified, familiar workflow however they are using Reports on a site.

Modules can be enabled and disabled to ensure only the relevant ones are available to users.
