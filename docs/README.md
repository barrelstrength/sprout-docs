# Why Sprout?

The Sprout Plugins are a premium suite of plugins designed for businesses who want to use Craft CMS as the core of their content management and digital marketing workflows.

Sprout Plugins provide a seamless Craft experience for content authors, an exceptional amount of flexibility for designers and developers, and comprehensive multi-site support for multi-regional and multi-lingual websites.

Sprout provides several new components to use in your content archicture including Forms, Emails, Lists, and Reports.

## Modular Architecture

Sprout's architecture is a bit different than other plugins. 

As we developed our plugins we observed that a lot of features that we were developing could benefit more than one use case. For example, our Reports features can be used on it's own, for running reports on Form submissions in Sprout Forms, to build dynamic email lists in Sprout Email. 

Rather than re-invent the wheel in each plugin, we chose to build out features like our Reports as a module that can be used by all of our plugins and for your custom reporting needs as well. This gives your users a unified, familiar experience for all of the different reports they need on a site.

If you have a small project and don't need all of our plugins: no problem. Modules can be enabled and disabled so you can make sure only the relevant ones are accessible for your users.
