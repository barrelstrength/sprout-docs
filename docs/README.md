## Digital Marketing

Sprout adds new components to use in your content architecture including Forms, Emails, and Reports.

Where Craft provides the excellent content management features, Sprout adds components specialized toward business and marketing use cases.

## Modular Architecture

As we developed Sprout we observed that a lot of features that we designed could benefit more than one use case. For example, our Reports features can be used on it's own, for running reports on Form submissions in Sprout Forms, and to build dynamic email lists in Sprout Email.

Rather than re-invent the wheel in each **plugin**, we chose to build out features such as Reports as a **module** that can be used by all of our plugins and for your custom reporting needs as well. Users experience a unified, familiar workflow however they are using Reports on a site.

Modules can be enabled and disabled to ensure only the relevant ones are available to users. Explore the full list of [module features](./features.md). Collectively, these modules are referred to as the Sprout Framework.

## Plugin Bundles

The key Sprout Plugins bundle multiple modules to provide their feature set. View the [Lite and Pro](./features.md) page to see a breakdown of features in each module.

| Plugin             | Modules                              |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| Sprout Forms       | Forms, Data Studio, Notifications    |
| Sprout Email       | Notifications, Campaigns, Sent Email |
| Sprout SEO         | Meta, Redirects, Sitemaps            |

While most websites benefit from the full feature set of the packages above, a few modules have been packaged in standalone plugins when they can also solve a narrow use case.

| Plugin             | Modules      |
|:-------------------|:-------------|
| Sprout Data Studio | Data Studio  |
| Sprout Sitemaps    | Sitemaps     |
| Sprout Redirects   | Redirects    |
| Sprout Sent Email  | Sent Email   |
