# Update Guides

The [Sprout Framework Changelog](https://github.com/barrelstrength/craft-sprout) reflects the most recent updates to all of our plugins and can be found at the top level in the Github repo.

The guides below provide details for noteworthy upgrades such as breaking changes, new things to be aware of, or planned deprecation notices. For the best experience while upgrading, please review the relevant upgrade guides _before_ you upgrade.

### Craft 3

| Upgrading&nbsp;To       | Notes               | 
|:------------------------|:------------------- |
| [v4.40.0][#Upgradev440] | Major update |

#### Targeting older versions of Craft and Sprout

::: warning THERE IS A BETTER WAY
Sprout 4.x introduced a new plugin architecture and solved several migration issues that had arisen in the older architecture. Depending on your situation, upgrading to a version of Craft and Sprout before Sprout 4.x can get tedious and the newer version is a much better experience. We recommend avoiding this path and updating to the latest version of Craft 3.x and Sprout 4.x if possible.
:::

To upgrade Craft and Sprout to a version earlier than Craft v3.7.x and Sprout 4.x, please review the [Installing &amp; Updating][#v3Docs] section in the Sprout v3 documentation for the specific plugins you are updating.

### Craft 2

Review the [Installing &amp; Updating][#v2Docs] section in the Sprout v2 documentation for the specific plugins you are updating.
