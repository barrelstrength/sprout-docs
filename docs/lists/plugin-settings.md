## Settings

Settings can be managed in the Control Panel _Sprout Lists â†’ Settings_ or via a config file in `config/sprout-lists.php`

``` php
<?php

return [
    // The name to display in the control panel in place of the plugin name
    'pluginNameOverride' => 'Sprout Lists',

    // Create a relationship between a Sprout Subscriber and a matching
    // Craft User, based on the email address
    'enableUserSync' => false,

    // Subscriber Lists will be automatically created when a subscribe form
    // is submitted and no matching List is found.
    'enableAutoList' => false
];
```

### Enable User Sync

When an `email address` is added to a Subscriber List, if the `email address` matches the address of a known `User ID` in Craft, Sprout Lists can create a link between the two. Enable this behavior the the Sprout Lists settings.

User Sync will behave as follows when enabled:

- When a new user is created in Sprout Lists, Sprout Lists will check if any Craft Users with a matching email address also exist. If so, Sprout Lists will create a link between the two.
- When a new user is created and saved in Craft, if there are any matching Subscribers in Sprout Lists, their Sprout Lists Subscriber Records will be linked to the Craft User account.
- When any updates are made to the Email, First Name, and Last Name fields of a Sprout Lists Subscriber or Craft User, those updates will be reflected in both places

::: warning
With User Sync enabled, if you submit a blank value for the First Name or Last Name fields (in Sprout List or Craft), the field will also be updated with a blank value in the other location. You will need to enforce First Name and Last Name fields as required if necessary.
