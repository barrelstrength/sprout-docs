# About Sprout Lists

Sprout Lists allows you create lists. Lists can be useful so users can:

- Subscribe and unsubscribe to an Email Newsletter
- Subscribe and unsubscribe to be notified about updates
- Follow or un-follow someone to find something more easily
- Like or unlike an item to express approval
- Up-vote or down-vote something to express interest

Sprout Lists provides two additional Elements in Craft: **Lists** and **Subscribers**.

Create custom Lists and standalone subscribers or designate any existing Element as a List and treat Users as Subscribers. You have the flexibility to create advanced relationships that you can leverage in your user interface, reporting, and email marketing efforts.

::: tip
We will use the term **Subscribe** throughout the docs, but you can substitute in the terms **Follow** or **Like** or **Vote** as you prefer.
