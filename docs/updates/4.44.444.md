# Upgrading to v4.44.444

Sprout `4.44.444` provides a familiar author experience, introduces a simplified plugin architecture with the Sprout Framework module, and removes the need for a number of dependencies that were causing several permission and migration issues on Craft 3 websites. Designers and developers will want to read through these upgrade notes carefully - several things have changed.

## Prepare to upgrade

1. Review all upgrade guides for Craft and Sprout to prepare for your upgrade
2. Review the 'Breaking Changes' section of the Sprout Module changelogs
3. Confirm that all of the Sprout plugins that you want to upgrade are available on Craft 4. See the [Road Map](../support/road-map.md).
4. Confirm that you have a migration path for any plugins that will not be available on Craft 4. See the [Road Map](../support/road-map.md).

## Upgrade

1. Update to the latest version of Craft 3
2. Update all installed Sprout plugins to the most recent version on Craft 3
3. Upgrade to Craft 4 (This step will trigger Sprout migrations for plugins with the same name)
4. Install any Sprout plugins with new names to trigger their respective migrations

## Breaking Changes

### All Sprout modules

- See [CHANGELOG-CORE](https://github.com/barrelstrength/craft-sprout/blob/v4/CHANGELOG) for a full list of changes
- All Twig variables now use the `sprout` variable
- All Default templates sets can now be included from the site template root `_sprout`
- All Example templates can now be included from the site template root `_sprout/examples`
- All plugin settings are now managed in their respective modules
- Plugins no longer support an _Alternate Name_ setting
- Any references to Sprout Project Config settings keys will need to be updated
- All custom APIs have new routes and namespaces

### Reports => Data Studio

::: warning
Due to this plugin's name change (Reports => Data Studio) you will need to manually install it after upgrading to Craft 4 to trigger its migrations. If you have any Report-related dashboard widgets you may see an error when you first login to your Craft 4 control panel. Navigate directly to the plugins page `/admin/settings/plugins` to install the plugin.
:::

- See [CHANGELOG-DATA-STUDIO](https://github.com/barrelstrength/craft-sprout/blob/v4/CHANGELOG) for a full list of changes
- Sprout Reports has been renamed to Sprout Data Studio
- Sprout Data Studio now has a Lite and Pro Edition
- Existing Sprout Reports license holders will be upgraded to a Sprout Data Studio Pro license
- Updated variable `craft.sproutReports` => `sprout.twigDataSet`
- Twig Template Data Sources that use a Craft DateTime picker in their templates will need to update the date syntax to use Twig the [date function](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/upgrade.html#template-functions)
- Twig Template Data Sources should update `{%- includejs %}` => `{%- js %}`
- Any references to the Project Config settings key should be updated `sprout-reports` => `sprout-module-data-studio`
- Custom DataSources should use `BarrelStrength\Sprout\datastudio\datasources\DataSource` (See `vendor/barrelstrength/sprout/src/datastudio/components/datasources` for examples)
- Access Data Source permissions have been removed in favor of Craft User permissions. Confirm any permissions that were previously assigned to Data Sources are now assigned to the User Groups appropriately.
