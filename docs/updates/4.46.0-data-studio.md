# Upgrading to Data Studio v4.46.0

This release includes a breaking change if you are using Source Groups to group your Data Sets. Sprout provided a method to group Data Sets in Craft 3 and due to some inconsistencies with multi-site functionality we have decided to remove this from Craft 4, effective immediately, in favor of using the Data Studio Global Field Layout and Craft's native Custom Sources.

As plugin migrations should only touch schema controlled by the plugin itself, you will need to manually implement this change if you desire to group your Data Sets in the sidebar of the element index page. No Data Set settings are changed in this update aside from the group metadata.

## Breaking Changes

To implement custom sources for your Data Set you must be an Admin:

1. Add a custom Dropdown or Relation field to your Data Set field layout `Settings->Data Studio->Field Layout`
2. Edit any Data Sets you want to group and select the appropriate value in your new field
3. On the Data Sets Element Index page, select the gear icon and choose "Customize Sources"
4. From the "Customize Sources" modal, select the `+` icon and choose "New custom source"
5. Give your custom source a Label and select your Custom Field and Data Set Criteria to create a Condition Rule
6. Repeat step 5 for each custom source you want to add
