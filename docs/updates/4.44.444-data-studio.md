# Upgrading to Data Studio v4.44.444

Sprout Reports is now Sprout Data Studio.

## Breaking Changes

::: warning
Due to this plugin's name change (Reports => Data Studio) you will need to manually install it after upgrading to Craft 4 to trigger its migrations. If you have any Report-related dashboard widgets you may see an error when you first login to your Craft 4 control panel. Navigate directly to the plugins page `/admin/settings/plugins` to install the plugin.
:::

- See the general [upgrade guide][#400-framework] for Sprout Modules to 4.0
- Sprout Reports has been renamed to Sprout Data Studio
- Sprout Data Studio now has a Lite and Pro Edition
- Existing Sprout Reports license holders will be upgraded to a Sprout Data Studio Pro license
- Updated variable `craft.sproutReports` => `sprout.twigDataSet`
- Twig Template Data Sources that use a Craft DateTime picker in their templates will need to update the date syntax to use Twig the [date function](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/upgrade.html#template-functions)
- Twig Template Data Sources should update `{%- includejs %}` => `{%- js %}`
- Any references to the Project Config settings key should be updated `sprout-reports` => `sprout-module-data-studio`
- Custom DataSources should use `BarrelStrength\Sprout\datastudio\datasources\DataSource` (See `vendor/barrelstrength/sprout/src/datastudio/components/datasources` for examples)
- Access Data Source permissions have been removed in favor of Craft User permissions. Confirm any permissions that were previously assigned to Data Sources are now assigned to the User Groups appropriately.
- Date Sources used as email lists will need to be migrated manually to Audience Types (once the email module is released)
