# About Sprout Reports

Sprout Reports allows you to create and group custom reports.

Reports can be created from our default Data Sources or you can create your own. Sprout Reports comes with two flexible Data Sources out of the box and additional Data Sources are available via custom plugins.

| Data Sources     | Notes       |
|:---------------- |:------------- |
| Custom Query     |  |
| Twig Template    |  |
| Categories       |  |
| Users            |  |
| Commerce         | [Sprout Reports for Craft Commerce](https://github.com/barrelstrength/craft-sprout-reports-commerce) |

To create a report, select your Report Type, give your report a Name, and update any settings available to customize the results of your report.  Once your report is setup, you can export your report data in CSV format or run your report in the browser.

If you would like to display a single number report on your dashboard, you can add a new `Single Number Report` widget.  Give your widget a name, select which single number report the widget is associated with, and you can keep track of that info right on your dashboard.
