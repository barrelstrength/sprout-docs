# About Sent Email

Sent Email Elements capture instances of emails that are sent by Craft. Sent Emails can be used to review Sent Emails, provide a bit more information for some customer support inquiries, and troubleshoot CMS deliverability issues, and re-send email to your users.

Sent Emails are not a comprehensive solution to tracking email interactions. They are a convenience in some scenarios, and limited in what they can track and by how many can be reasonably stored in the CMS database. 

While Sent Emails may indicate an email has been successfully sent by Craft, this status does not indicate anything about the deliverability of the Sent Emails. To get additional information on whether an email was delivered or bounced, consider using an email service provider such as Mailgun, Sendgrid, or other similar services.

## Settings

Read the [Config Settings](./../configuration/sprout-config.md) documentation to explore and customize settings.

## Updates

See [update guides](../configuration/updates.md) for the Sent Email and Framework modules.
