Improvements or corrections to the docs can be submitted as a pull request.</p><p>Small edits can be made via the browser and Github&#39;s edit tools. To preview any significant documentation changes before committing them, you can review your changes locally. The documentation is powered by VuePress. Clone the documentation repository, go to the <code>docs/</code> folder within your terminal, and run these commands:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme line-numbers-mode"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span># Install npm dependencies</span></span>

As much as we appreciate community contributions, we are selective about which sorts of features should make it into Sprout itself rather than a plugin, so don‚Äôt take it the wrong way if we advise you to pursue the idea as a plugin instead.</p><h2 id="pull-requests" tabindex="-1">Pull Requests <a class="header-anchor" href="#pull-requests" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Pull Requests&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Please ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project&#39;s developers might not want to merge into the project.</p><p>Pull requests should clearly describe the problem and solution and provide a step-by-step explanation of how to test, if possible. Include the relevant issue number if there is one.</p><h2 id="translations" tabindex="-1">Translations <a class="header-anchor" href="#translations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Translations&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>You can add a translation file to your project using <a href="https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/sites.html#static-message-translations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Static Translations</a> and target Sprout Forms using the translation categories that it uses. Sprout plugins may rely on multiple modules in the underlying Sprout Framework if you want full a complete translation. For example, Sprout Forms relies on the Forms, Data Studio, Transactional Email, and Core modules which would all need to be translated to provide a full translation of Sprout Forms.</p>`,22),n=[i];function r(l,u,d,c,p,h){return a(),t("div",null,n)}const b=e(o,[["render",r]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
