# Sprout Docs

See our website for the complete [Sprout Documentation](https://sprout.barrelstrengthdesign.com/docs/).

## Updating the docs

Sprout Documentation uses [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/).

Documentation Markdown files are stored in the `/docs` folder. For each major Craft release, all documentation pages are copied to a new version of the docs and updated for any changes in that release. Previous versions of the docs are archived on their respective branches.

Some useful commands while working with the docs:

| Command                      | Notes                                             |
|:-----------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| npm install                  | Get everything working                            |
| npm run docs:dev             | Spins up a VitePress dev server)                  |
| npm&nbsp;run&nbsp;docs:build | Generates static site, handled during deployment) |
